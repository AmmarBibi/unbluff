"""Mutation harness: revert each fix on a scratch copy and require the suite to go RED.

A test that stays green when you delete the code it covers is decorative. Three tests written
on 2026-07-29 asserted things the implementation could not violate, and the v1.3.0 release was
declared closeable twice while 34 defects sat in it - both because "the suite passes" was read
as "the suite asks the right questions". This turns that into a mechanical check.

Each mutation names the plan finding it reverts. A mutation whose suite stays GREEN is a
FAILURE of this harness: it means the regression test for that finding does not bite.

    python tools/mutation_check.py                 # every mutation
    python tools/mutation_check.py pre_push_gate   # only mutations for one hook

Mutations marked posix_only are skipped on Windows (os.chmod exec bits are a no-op there), so
they are the ones only CI can prove.
